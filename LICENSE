PREAMBLE

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the
LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.

You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright
and which you wish to distribute.

This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed
and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of
that work may be distributed.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the
freedom to make and distribute modified versions of the work, while
maintaining the integrity of the original author's work. If you
modify the work, you must change the name of the work, and you must
not distribute the modified work under the name of the original work.

This ensures that those who depend on the work will not be misled
into using a modified version when they think they are using the
original.
