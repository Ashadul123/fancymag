    \msg{Someone}{Designation}{Message from that person}{Affiliation}{img/msg.png}{img/m_sig.png}{3.5cm}{
    	\lettrine{T}{}he  \texttt{\textbackslash msg} command is a custom LaTeX macro defined in the \texttt{mag.sty} package. It is designed to format and display figures in a structured manner, placing them either to the left or right depending on the page type. This command helps maintain consistency in figure placement throughout a document.\\    	
    	The  \texttt{\textbackslash msg} command takes eight arguments and follows the syntax:\\
    	\texttt{\textbackslash msg\{arg1\}\{arg2\}\{arg3\}\{arg4\}\{arg5\}\{arg6\}\{arg7\}\{arg8\}}\\
    	Here, \texttt{arg1} and \texttt{arg2} typically define the figure source and description, while \texttt{arg4} through \texttt{arg7} control its size, alignment, and labeling. Arguments \texttt{arg3} and \texttt{arg8} may have specific uses depending on the document's requirements.\\
    	One key feature of  \texttt{\textbackslash msg} is its ability to adjust figure placement based on whether the current page is odd or even. Internally, the command calls \texttt{\textbackslash msgfigurer} for odd-numbered pages, aligning figures to the right, and \texttt{\textbackslash msgfigurel} for even-numbered pages, aligning figures to the left. This ensures that figures always appear near the outer margin, enhancing readability in two-sided documents.\\
    	A sample implementation using the  \texttt{\textbackslash msg} command might look like this:\\
    	\texttt{\textbackslash msg\{Figure1\}\{Description\}\{Unused\}\{0.5\}\{Center\}\{Scale\}\{Label\}\{Extra\}}\\
    	This structure allows the document to dynamically format figures based on the page number, making it a useful tool for professional reports and books.\\
    	To use  \texttt{\textbackslash msg}, ensure that \texttt{mag.sty} is included in your LaTeX project. Since some arguments may be ignored depending on the internal logic, refer to additional package documentation for precise customization. The ability to vary figure placement with page parity makes this command particularly useful for creating well-structured, visually appealing documents.}

  	{It is Abstract}  	
  	{\lettrine{T}{}he \texttt{particle1} environment is a custom LaTeX construct used to create a stylized profile or informational block. It accepts nine arguments, which include textual information, an image path, an abstract and a main body of content. This environment is suitable for formatting personal profiles, author introductions, interview or structured descriptions in a visually engaging format.\\
  	The syntax is as follows:\\
  	\texttt{\textbackslash begin\{particle1\}\{Title\}\{Detail 1\}\{Name\}\\\{Detail 2\}\{Detail 3\}\{Detail 4\}\{img.png\}\\\{Abstract\}\{Main Text\}\\\textbackslash end\{particle1\}}\\
  	\bullet \textbf{The first argument}, \texttt{Title}, is used as the main heading or role, such as "Professor" or "Lead Scientist".\\
  	\bullet \textbf{The second argument}, \texttt{Detail 1}, typically describes a category or department, such as ``Astrophysics Division".\\
  	\bullet \textbf{The third argument}, \texttt{Name}, is the full name of the person being described.\\  	
  	\bullet \textbf{ The fourth, fifth, and sixth arguments} - \texttt{Detail 2}, \texttt{Detail 3}, and \texttt{Detail 4} â€” are additional attributes or information related to the subject, such as degrees, research areas, affiliations, achievements, or roles.\\  	
  	\bullet \textbf{The seventh argument} is the image path, such as \texttt{img/author.png}, pointing to a profile picture or representative image that will be displayed alongside the text.\\  	
  	\bullet \textbf{The eighth argument} is an abstract or summary sentence that concisely describes the subject's main role, focus, or expertise. It serves as a short introduction or tagline.\\  	
  	\bullet \textbf{The ninth and final argument} is the main body text. This is a longer paragraph or content block that provides a detailed explanation or narrative about the subject.}  		
  	\end{particle1}
  	
	\begin{particle1}{Particle 1}{detail 1}{Name}{detail 2}{detail 3}{detail 4}{img/msg1.png}
	{It is Abstract}
	{\textbf{Note:} The visual layout of the \texttt{particle1} environment may depend on whether it appears on an \textbf{odd} or \textbf{even} page. In many designs, the placement of the image and text is reversed or mirrored to maintain symmetry in double-sided documents. This behavior is typically implemented using conditional checks within the environment's definition. As a result, the final appearance may vary depending on the page number where the environment is placed.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Article Type 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   
  \titlepg{Article Type 2}

    \begin{particle2}{Title}{Author}{Detail 1}{Detail 2} {img/msg.png}{img/side.jpeg}
                
        The \texttt{particle2} environment is a custom LaTeX, which is well-suited for article-style entries, research summaries, or section headers that include detailed narrative text and embedded visuals.
        
        The syntax is as follows:
        
        \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{particle2\}\{Title\}\{Author\}\{Detail 1\}\{Detail 2\}\{author.png\}\{side.jpeg\}}\\
        \texttt{Body text (including paragraphs, figures, etc.)}\\
        \texttt{\textbackslash end\{particle2\}}
        
        This environment takes six arguments before the body content begins. These arguments are used to build a structured header or banner area before rendering the main text.
        
        The arguments are:
        
        \bullet \textbf{Title} â€“ The title or heading of the section, often representing a topic or article name.
        
        \bullet \textbf{Author} â€“ The name of the author or contributor for this content block.
        
        \bullet \textbf{Detail 1} â€“ A short detail such as a role, subtitle, or classification label.
        
        \bullet \textbf{Detail 2} â€“ Another short descriptor, for example, affiliation or focus area.
        
        \bullet \textbf{msg.png} â€“ The primary image, typically used as a profile photo or symbolic image, placed near the title and author.
        
        \bullet \textbf{side.jpeg} â€“ A secondary image which appears as sidebar  background for the first page only.
        
    \end{particle2}
    
    \begin{particle2}{Title}{Author}{Detail 1}{Detail 2} {img/msg.png}{img/di1.png}
    	
		\textbf{Note:} The visual layout of the \texttt{particle2} environment may depend on whether it appears on an \textbf{odd} or \textbf{even} page. In many designs, the placement of the image and text is reversed or mirrored to maintain symmetry in double-sided documents. This behavior is typically implemented using conditional checks within the environment's definition. As a result, the final appearance may vary depending on the page number where the environment is placed.
